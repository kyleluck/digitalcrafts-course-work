## Agile

* why?
  * criticism of waterfall model
    * waterfall model phases
      * requirements
      * design
      * implementation
      * verification
      * maintenance
    * clients often don't know what they want, until seeing working software for the first time. Then they want to change the requirements
    * doesn't not adapt to change well, assumptions are broken, decisions change, market conditions change
    * I have heard stories of projects at big companies like IBM where they would spend a whole year just to write up the requirement documents
    * when the clients want to change the requirements, what happens is you start over from the top of the waterfall again, redesign the whole thing, and sometimes even rebuild the whole thing. a lot of time is wasted. And a lot of times there is contention about who should absorb the cost of the requirement change, how much is the bill for the change, and everyone is unhappy.

### Scrum

* Roles
  * product owner - authority, vision, and availability. Makes decisions about where the product is going. Answers questions about ambiguities.
  * scrum master - facilitator for the product owner and the team. Tries to remove road blocks.
  * team members - 3 - 9 members. The team decides what the tasks are each week.
* Sprints
  * a sprint is an iteration cycle
  * there is working software at the end of each sprint
  * typically 2-4 weeks long
  * meetings
    * daily stand up meetings - each report he did yesterday and what to do today. should not take long.
    * sprint planning - beginning of each sprint
    * sprint demo - demo the working product to product owner and team
    * sprint retrospective - end of each sprint

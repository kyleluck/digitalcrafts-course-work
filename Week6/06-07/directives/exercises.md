# Angular Directives Exercises

1. Re-create the Hello World Directive from scratch.
2. Make a "Good Job" Directive. Used like this: `<good-job name="'Amjad'"></good-job>`. Which displays "Good job, Amjad!". You can optionally use a scope property instead of a string literal to set the name. Hint: use hello2.html as an example.
3. Choose a bootstrap component from: http://getbootstrap.com/components/ and make a directive for it. Make it as easy to use as you can.
4. Bonus: make a directive that has some JavaScript functionality. Easy: a toggle button that changes color or text when clicked. Harder: a todo list.
